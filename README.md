# Lives

This repo is a main codebase of project Lives.

## Current plan

1. Landing page
2. Start creation some user and lessons functionality
3. MAJOR: Create stream + chat platform

## Stack

It makes sense to select as a main too NextJS to support for landing SEO, as well as react SPA when needed.

Other tools like streaming and chatbox might require microservices build on top of express.
